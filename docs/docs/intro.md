# Welcome to QuickJS

QuickJS is a small and embeddable Javascript engine. It supports the [ES2023] specification
including modules, asynchronous generators, proxies, BigInt and more.

This project is a _fork_ of the [original QuickJS project] by Fabrice Bellard, after it went
dormant for several years.
